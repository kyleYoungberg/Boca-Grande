# Boca-Grande
Website for a conceptual graphic design company
Boca Grande
Goals I accomplished:
Make a modern looking website for a conceptual graphic design company
Use Javascript to have interactive elements I hadn't worked with before


Things that I would change:
the numbers in the corner of the slideshow are hard to see on certain photos, I would remove it or make it change color depending on the image
Less space between the subtitles and their corresponding form elements in the contact form
